# General and Simple Common Practices

## This is not mandatory, but will make development process more accessible for all of us

* I personally use this [ToDo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) VSCODE extension to highlight TODO and FIXME, so if anyone will be working on the same file and encountered any TODO or FIXME, it will be highlighted for them.

* Please make sure you `git pull` first before pushing any changes, and if possible review any breaking code before pushing
